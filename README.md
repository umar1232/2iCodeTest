# 2iCodeTest

## Assumptions:
###    - List of numbers isn't required from user as an input or as a file and is already in the code.
###    - The code will still work if there are less than 4 duplicates and will remove all duplicates.
###    - An empty list will be outputted if the list contains only duplicates.
###    - The code will only remove identical values i.e. if there is a 6 and 6.0, this will not count as identical and wont be removed.
